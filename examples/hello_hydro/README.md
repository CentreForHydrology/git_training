Hello Hydro
=======

### Getting started
1.  Fork this repo
2.  Clone your fork
3.  Checkout a new branch

### Making changes

This should take less than 5 minutes.  

1.  Start by adding a personalized `hello_world` statement to the `letters.py` module.  If you don't usually write in Python, the examples in the existing file should allow you to just copy a function (e.g. `hello_joe`) and make a few changes.  
2.  Call your hello_world function from the `hello_hydro.py` script.  This script is executable from the command line.  Again, the examples in the script should be sufficient to explain how to do this for the Python beginner.  

### Running the Script
Running `./hello_hydro.py` from the terminal should do the trick.  

Make sure to run the script after you make your changes to make sure it still works.  

### Contribute your changes to the `UW-Hydro` repository.
